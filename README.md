## Brief Introduction

I am a cybersecurity engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for securing digital systems. My skills include network security, penetration testing, and digital forensics, with hands-on experience developing projects like a network traffic sniffer, pentesting automation, and a basic SIEM system. I am proficient in Python and have a solid understanding of networking, database management, and information security principles. I have worked with tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, and Burp Suite, continuously expanding my knowledge in ethical hacking, threat detection, and incident response. I am committed to honing my skills and contributing to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.


## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. I am building a cybersecurity portfolio to showcase my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and deep understanding of security concepts. My projects focus on areas such as network security, penetration testing, digital forensics, and threat detection. Through hands-on development, I create tools and scripts for ethical hacking, security automation, and incident response. This portfolio serves as a testament to my commitment to cybersecurity, allowing me to contribute to the community, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and continuously enhance my expertise to tackle real-world security challenges.
